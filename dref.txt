Page 1 / 15Description of the Event
What happened, where and when?
The Intense Tropical Cyclone Freddy will make landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar on Tuesday 21 February. 
The Mahanoro, Mananjary and Nosy Varita communes in western Madagascar will be ﬁrst-hit on Tuesday. Rain bands 
caused by Freddy are already starting to impact the country. It's projected that up to 1.8 million people, mostly in 
Madagascar, will be impacted by storm surges and ﬂooding, according to the Global Disaster Alert and Coordination 
System. 
Mozambique will likely be struck on Friday, according to the country's national meteorology institute.
The National Society has started responding by prepositioning disaster preparedness stock, mobilizing volunteers 
to the high-risk districts. The NS is also mobilizing volunteers for disseminating the alert information and messages 
on preventive measures.
Scope and Scale
As of noon on Feb 21, Freddy was located 445 km from Reunion and approaching Madagascar. Two regions have 
been placed on red alert (notice of imminent danger), 9 under yellow alert (threat), while 4 regions are under green 
alert (warning). TC Freddy is expected to make landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar is Tuesday Feb. 21 
evening as a tropical cyclone generating devastating winds. The location of the landing zone is likely to be north 
of Mananjary. According to GDACs Tropical Cyclone FREDDY can have a high humanitarian impact based on the 
maximum sustained wind speed, exposed population and vulnerability.
Page 2 / 15It's predicted that TC Freddy will bring strong winds and intense rains. It should be noted that Freddy will pass through 
areas weakened by the system CHENESO (3 weeks ago) and this will bring more impact. TC Freddy represents a 
signiﬁcant ﬂood risk as soils are already saturated in central parts of the island from the impact of Cheneso. Shelter 
and livelihoods damage are predicted, health and water infrastructure and services will be interrupted. 
Storm surge is likely to cause coastal inundation in risk areas. The govt have advised ﬁsherfolk not to go to sea.
Displacements are likely and the Ministry of Education has made schools available as temporary shelters. The BNGRC 
is coordinating the monitoring of the situation in collaboration with all administrative, humanitarian and community 
actors. Vigilance alerts have been issued in all regions of the country, particularly those likely to be aﬀected.
Latest key ﬁgures, dated 20Feb:
• It’s a category 4 tropical storm.
• The overall alert level is Red for Madagascar, Mozambique
• Maximum windspeed recorded: 222 km/h [WMO/La Réunion]
• Estimated exposed population with the current path: 1.4M category 1 or above [GDACS]

The Tropical Cyclone Freddy will make landfall on the eastern coast of Madagascar on Tuesday 21 February. Rain 
bands caused by Freddy are already starting to impact the country.  While cyclones aﬀect Madagascar almost 
on a yearly basis, tropical cyclone Freddy is expected to have a major impact on the country given its projected 
intensity. While an there is also an active EA in country (running until June 2023) in response to the cyclone that 
aﬀected Madagascar in 2022, this DREF will be necessary in order to evaluate the needs and response in those 
areas not currently covered by that mechanism. 
MDRMG018 has been extended up to the end of June. Locations already being covered by appeal will be scaled 
up through the appeal. This DREF will cover new areas not covered by the appeal.
Specify how the lessons learnt from these previous operations are being used to mitigate similar chal-
lenges in the current operation
During the response to system CHENESO, a slight delay in responding was observed due to the lack of proper 
preparedness. This time the NS will ensure that preparedness is well planned in order to be agile on providing 
rapid response. 
During the response to Cyclone Batsirai, there was a challenge to intervene in some remote areas due to roads 
and bridges damage.
Page 3 / 15Current National Society Actions
Activation  Of  Contingency 
PlansThe NS contingency plan has been reviewed and is serving as reference for the 
current preparedness phase.
OtherA group WhatsApp has been created among the volunteers and staﬀ to 
facilitate the information ﬂow. The green phone number has been shared at 
the regional and communities' level as well.
National Society ReadinessThe NS has activated the operational center to check on its readiness. The NS 
also reviewed the available volunteers, equipment, tools, NFIs, procedures etc. 
Regarding the very remote areas, the NS is deploying volunteers to support 
those communities. 
Immediately after the cyclone lands, the volunteers will support  communities 
to support with evacuation of vulnerable populations, providing ﬁrst aid and 
PSS, assess the immediate needs, register those displaced to the accommo-
dation centres, and other necessary assistance.
AssessmentThe assessment tool has been reviewed and shared to all NDRTs, projects 
managers, regional governing board.
CoordinationExternal coordination with BNGRC, sectoral groups and government struc-
tures is maintained. Regular internal coordination with the PNSs and IFRC is 
organized on daily basis to asses the level of preparedness of the NS, as well 
as to better coordinate the response.
Movement Partners Actions Related To The Current 
Event
IFRCIndian Ocean Cluster Delegation is based in Madagascar and regularly pro-
vides technical and ﬁnancial support to Malagasy RC. The IFRC CCD is support-
ing the NS in the development of a plan of action and is ready to deploy the 
necessary human resources to support with the preparedness and response. 
The Africa Regional Oﬃce has deployed an Operations Coordinator to provide 
in-country support, and in addition 4 surge deployment alerts have been 
activated.
ICRC No ICRC oﬃce in the country
Participating National Soci-
etiesThe available PNSs are French RC, German RC and Luxembourg RC. They are 
providing support to facilitate the delivery of the kits to the zones likely to be 
aﬀected via PPP project. They also remain available to support the response 
when needed. 
The French Red Cross/PIROI has deployed a staﬀ to support in general assess-
ment and coordination. Luxembourg RC may look into more funding options 
to support the NS. 
Page 4 / 15The French Red Cross/PIROI provided shelter kits and kitchen sets and these 
items will be replenished through this DREF operation.
Other Actors Actions Related To The Current Event
Government has requested 
international assistanceNo
National authoritiesThe event is managed by the Prime Minister oﬃce through the National 
Bureau of Disaster Risk management (BNGRC, French acronym). The bureau is 
decentralized down to the regional and districts levels. The BNGRC is regularly 
sharing alert level through the green, yellow, Orange and Red color. Based 
on the color provided, Red Cross volunteers and the community leaders 
are carrying out awareness raising activities at community level to help the 
population at risk get rid of the danger. Regular coordination meetings let by 
the Governor of the regions are being held to assess the level of preparedness 
at the regional level. In addition, the BNGRC through the shelter sectoral group 
has assessed the potential relocation sites in case the impact of the disaster 
causes the displacement of people.
UN or other actorsThe UN agencies are active in the country and supporting in coordination 
and identiﬁcation of needs and capacities of humanitarian actors, community 
mobilization and deployment of stocks identiﬁcation of shelters deployment 
of staﬀ to risky areas. UN OCHA has also activated the crisis cell, and this is 
meeting on a regular basis. The RC is part of this cell.
IFRC are reviewing the need for Shelter Cluster coordintion support.
Are there major coordination mechanisms in place?
There is an active HCT, associated by the sectorial working groups to support the Government. The NS takes part 
into all the sectoral groups and especially lead the shelter working group.
Page 5 / 15Needs (Gaps) IdentiHed
Shelter Bousing And Settlements
According to the Madagascar Meteorological alert, Freddy is said to be accompanied by Heavy rain and strong 
wind which will probably have an impact on the shelter and settlement of the population of the regions at risk.
Shelter Cluster Coordination
The IFRC co-chairs the shelter cluster coordination, which has now been activated. There is a need for speciﬁc 
support to facilitate this, so a surge alert has been launched to support with this.
Livelihoods And basic Needs
Floods may aﬀect crops such as rice and fruits which are at a harvest stage. People are in great danger of loses 
their livelihoods and basic needs.
Water, Sanitation And Bygiene
Floods, wind and enclosure in the sites of accommodation may impact lack of safe water, proper hygiene and 
sanitation. The NS will join other humanitarians to preparedness and response.
Multi purpose cash grants
The NS is cash ready. There is a NS FSP , and cash distribution approved by the Government. The NS will reactivate 
the cash distribution procedures to ensure that all is set when the need shows up.
Operational Strategy
Overall ojkective of the operation
This DREF allocation aims to ensure readiness to respond of MRCS by allowing the movement of available stocks 
from warehouses closer to at-risk areas, deploy volunteers, ensure coordination with Government and partners, as 
well as ensure rapid assessments are conducted soon after the cyclone landfall, to allow full appreciation of the 
scale of the disaster and relating response planning.
In addition, the National Society, through this operation will be able to provide immediate relief to 750 households 
(3,750 people) from 3 Regions highlighted as at very high risk to be aﬀected. This initial support will be provided 
through multipurpose cash grants, shelter, health, psychosocial support and WASH activities, while assessment 
Page 6 / 15information obtained will permit a scale up of the response. Overall 7500 people will be supported also by WASH 
and Health services.
Its intended that any stocks distributed will be replenished via a scale up of the DREF after landfall.
Operation strategy rationale
Malagasy Red Cross is mobilizing to respond to Tropical Cyclone Freddy by deploying its capacity, conducting 
preparedness activities, and coordinating with humanization organizations. As part of that, and in order to better 
address the needs of the target population, the following activities are to be implemented:
1. Mobilization of staﬀ and volunteers for early warning/early action - awareness sessions for community prepared-
ness based on the alert levels
2. Mobilization of staﬀ and volunteers for rapid assessments
3. Preposition and distribution of emergency shelter, household essential items, hygiene items, dignity kits.
4. Mobilization of staﬀ and volunteers for health and WASH activities 
5. Coordinate with local, and national level Government and partners 
It is important to note that based upon early assessments after landfall, it is expected that the response will be scaled 
up in order to cover increased needs of the aﬀected population.
Targeting Strategy
Who will be targeted through this operation?
This DREF is being launched in order to complement the Emergency Appeal currently active in Madagascar (MDR-
MG018) and to provide support  to those areas forecasted to be greatly impacted, but that are not currently covered 
by any other response mechanism. This DREF will target two threatened regions, both which are already under red 
alerts.  In the case of both the DREF will only cover those districts not covered by the Batsirai EA nor by the ECHO 
PPP . 
 Three districts within the 2 regions that  be supported in each region, and this are the following: 
• In Vatovavy: IfanadianaIn 
• In Fitovinany: Manakara and Ikongo
Both region are under red alert in accordance BNGRC 
Given that the exact place of landfall is still to be conﬁrmed, it is too early to determine any further target communes 
that may need support. Yet, these three communes are being targeted based on predicted information from the 
government and the alert levels set in place. Among these groups, the most vulnerable households will be targeted 
as part of the selection criteria.
Explain the selection criteria for the targeted population
The selection criteria will be deﬁned by the aﬀected communities through the community engagement committees 
but will base on socio-economic criteria.
These persons in need will be identiﬁed through joint assessments by the MRCS and local disaster management 
committees based on set selection criteria as described below:
• Orphans and Vulnerable Children
• Female-Headed Households 
• Pregnant and lactating Women
• Elderly People
• People living with Disabilities 
• Chronically ill people
• Children head households

Ris/ and security considerations
Please indicate about potential operational risk for this operations and mitigation actions
Risk Mitigation action
Potential for TC Freddy to impact on areas already cov-
ered by the current Emergency Appeal.A response framework is being established to ensure 
clear areas of impact and subsequent response.
Continued rains, other possible cyclones (like in 2022)-
  which could impact the speed/eﬃciency of the re-
sponse. 
• Increased displacement of people 
• Destruction of WASH infrastructure
• Outbreak of water related disease
• Increased loss of livelihoods assetsNS will revise the DREF operation through an Operations 
update to widen the scope of intervention, with possible 
change of strategy, increased timeframe and possibly a 
request for a second allocation, with 
 continued alert and volunteers on standby. 
NS will also engage with communities for 
early warning, preparedness, and disaster risk reduction 
measures, in addition to continued work on prepared-
ness actions to mitigate impact of such meteorological 
events on communities.
A second weather system has been forecast behind TC 
Freddy - still too early to accurately project track/impactMonitor the situation and as per above be prepared to 
scale up activities.
Please indicate any security and safety concerns for this operation
There is no major security risk in the area of intervention. However, the security measures will be applied all along 
the operations timeframe.  
One speciﬁc expected security risk is linked to the need to distribute the cash in envelops due to the absence of 
cash points and telephone network, which exposes the FSP/staﬀ/volunteers distributing the cash.  To mitigate such 
incidents during the operation, all security measures of both the Movement and the Government will be strictly 
adhered to by all volunteers and staﬀ involved in the operation to reduce risks. 
The security management as part of this operation will be based on the RCRC Fundamental Principles and 
humanitarian values. In addition, the following actions related to security will be implemented: 
• These measures include the respect of visibility through the wearing of jackets and regular communication on all 
the movements.
• Regular brieﬁngs will be organized to remind volunteers and staﬀ on their behaviour and Safer Access.
• Coordination will be maintained between the NS and IFRC to ensure that all security measures are respected.
• Constant communication check-in measures with base by all operation staﬀ will be sustained.
• The use of two vehicles convoy, compliance with speed limits and other regulations. 
• Regular security updates will be organized, and information disseminated. 
• Real time monitoring of ﬁeld activities through the MRCS information management system. 
• The use of other IT means of contact system to ensure communications during follow-up missions.

How will this operation be monitored?
IFRC IOI CCD will provide MRCS with the necessary PMER support, especially with regards to monitoring and reporting 
of this DREF operation. Regular ﬁeld visits by both the Surge and MRCS teams will ensure daily/weekly supervision 
of activities, in the ﬁrst few weeks of the operation. The assessment planned will allow for any eventual review of the 
operation strategy, scope or timeframe through an operation update, which will be the responsibility of the surge 
to provide. 
Further, ﬁeld staﬀ will provide weekly updates/reports about the ongoing operation to the Disaster Response 
Manager based at the HQ.  MRCS will be responsible for providing an operational and ﬁnancial report (2 months 
after the end of the operation). This way, IFRC IOI Cluster will consolidate and ensure publishing within 3 months 
from the end of operation.
Please brieﬂy explain the National Societies communication strategy for this operation.
To support volunteers in their mission as well as the visibility of Red Cross actions on the ground, MRCS through this 
DREF operation will procure protection and visibility items for volunteers including Red Cross bibs, raincoats and 
gumboots. 
This will be in addition, eight (8) megaphones and 10 MRCS ﬂags which will be used during awareness activities. 
Some 1,500 IEC materials will equally be produced to promote hygiene awareness. In addition, a communications 
strategy is also being developed, which will include key messages. IFRC CCD communications oﬃcer is currently in 
Marajary, and will be further supported by a surge communications coordinator. The communications oﬃcer and 
coordinator (surge) will work closely with the NS to support with their communications materials.
